# Pezzetti
*A package of little pieces.*

This package centralizes utils I've developed along the way. Rather than continually repeat myself, I'll just DRY out these pieces and put them in this toolbox.

## Installation

For now, I'd recommend installing it into a conda environment via pip with the `-e` *editable* flag.

```bash
(geo_env) matt@matt:~/.../pezzetti$ python -m pip install -e .
```
